The target of this script is an example of using d3.js to display sports competition results. We got the data from the 2008-2013 ANZ championship, there have ten teams from New Zealand and Australia.

We designed a line chart and a bar chart to show the results from two angles.

The version we used is d3.v3 and d3.v4. We also used jquery to build the structure of this webpage.
